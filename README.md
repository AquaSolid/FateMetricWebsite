FateMetric is currently in pre-alpha. 
There is a GitHub repository link provided at the bottom of the page, in the footer.

FateMetric is powered by the Python framework, Django. It's currently a simple blog where a person can log in, make a post, view other posts and even comment on them.

Besides the blog, there are plans to release further features as soon as possible. Simple features are still lacking, such as the simple "Like" feature, "Dislike", "Comment" as well as the "Add Category" feature. But aside from these features, we assume will be straightforward to make, there are more demanding features, such as the "Chat" application and "Games" application.

The "Chat" one is easily comprehensible, but the "Games" one is planned to be more of a platform which allows others to upload games, primarily made using Unity.

Furthermore, with regard to the blog, it is recommended that the posts be unique, in the sense that they provide original content, a creative view or opinion on a certain subject or material.

Thank you for using this website, we hope you enjoy the content provided by some of our users and/or staff.

For more information, feel free to contact us using the feature at the bottom of the page.
